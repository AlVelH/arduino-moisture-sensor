# YL-69/YL-38 Arduino sensor example

This is a simple program demonstrating how to read data from the cheap YL-69/YL-38 moisture sensor.  This is just a hobby project, as google will tell you, these sensors aren't meant for "production" use!

The example project only toggles on the sensor before performing a reading, and powers it down after the read has been completed.  In my case, readings once every 30 seconds is fine.

## Usage

* Copy the libraies/MoistureSensor folder to your Arduino Libraries directory.
* Run the program, tweak and water your damn plants.
